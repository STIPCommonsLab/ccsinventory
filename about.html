        <p>This project is led by the Commons Lab within the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. The Commons Lab’s mission is to mobilize public participation and innovation in science, technology, and policy through research and development.</p>
        <p>

<p>Within this vision, the <strong>Commons Lab Database</strong> exists to characterize the value and diversity of federal crowdsourcing and citizen science to support coordination within and between agencies, and facilitate public analysis and engagement. Key information about this database is summarized in the following FAQs.</p>

        <h3>How do you define crowdsourcing and citizen science?</h3>

        <p>The Commons Lab recognizes the <a href="http://www2.epa.gov/innovation/federal-community-practice-crowdsourcing-and-citizen-science">Federal Community of Practice for Crowdsourcing and Citizen Science</a> (FCPCCS)’s definitions of citizen science, crowdsourcing, and open innovation:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Citizen science</strong> is a form of open collaboration where members of the public participate in the scientific process to address real-world problems in ways that include identifying research questions, collecting and analyzing data, interpreting results, making new discoveries, developing technologies and applications, and solving complex problems.</li>

            <li><strong>Crowdsourcing</strong> is a process of obtaining needed services, ideas, or content by soliciting contributions from a large group of people, and especially from an online community.</li>

            <li><strong>Open innovation</strong> is a paradigm that suggests that organizations can and should solicit contributions from external volunteers.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>At the same time, a recent workshop held at the Wilson Center demonstrated the need to further disambiguate citizen science, crowdsourcing, and related forms of open innovation. For this reason, the Commons Lab is interested in collecting information about projects that are considered <strong>citizen science, crowdsourcing, and open innovation</strong> (including crowdmapping, making/ DIY activities, etc.).</p>

        <p><em>Special note</em>: We are not collecting information about projects that can be considered prize competitions. These fall under the jurisdiction of a separate federal community of practice with over 500 working members.</p>

        <h3>How are you collecting this data?</h3>

        <p>While we began by compiling information from public sources and scientific literature, we now ask project coordinators to add their project to the database by completing out an interactive web form. This will ensure that key information, such as public contact, is accurate and up to date.</p>

        <h3>What type of agency involvement do you want to capture?</h3>

        <p>We are looking for projects that are funded or otherwise supported by federal agencies. These projects may be funded directly, or through grants from agencies such as EPA, NIH, and USGS.  Other projects may receive in-kind support, including equipment lending or support from agency personnel. All agencies that provide financial or in kind support should be recognized in the “agency sponsor” field of the web form.</p>

        <p><em>Special note</em>: We will include projects funded by NSF that also receive financial or in kind support from other federal agencies. For example, the Smithsonian receives significant funding from NSF.  If one NSF grant supports a citizen science or crowdsourcing project, that project should be included in the database.</p>

        <h3>What is the process for data verification?</h3>

        <p>When a user adds a project to the database, the project will not immediately be published. A Wilson Center employee will verify the project to confirm that it does represent federal citizen science or crowdsourcing before publishing it in the database. In most cases, verification will take place within two business days.</p>


        <h3>What are the terms of use for your data? Who will you share data with?</h3>

        <p>The Commons Lab will not claim copyright of their database; rather, the database will be placed in the public domain. Note that all federal data sets uploaded to data.gov are also placed in the public domain. This allows all interested parties to use the data freely and without restriction. In line with this ideal, the Commons Lab will develop a suite of APIs to promote data sharing.</p>


        <h3>What are the plans for sustainability of this database?</h3>

        <p>The Commons Lab will work with citizen science contacts at various agencies, as well as the FCPCCS at large, to assure that information about projects is kept accurate and up to date. We will also work with external collaborators, including Scistarter.com and the U.S. Citizen Science Association, to ensure accuracy.</p>
