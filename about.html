        <h3>Project rationale</h3>
        <p>
          Recent policy, including the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/docs/us_national_action_plan_6p.pdf">Second Open Government National Action
            Plan</a> published in December 2013, and the OSTP fact sheet released in
          March 2015, offer important support for federal citizen science and
          crowdsourcing. These developments will help sustain existing projects,
          and inspire new initiatives. The Commons Lab Inventory seeks to
          support federal engagement in citizen science and crowdsourcing
          by:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><em>Characterizing the value and diversity of federal citizen
              science</em>
            . The Commons Lab will provide a web application and publish a policy brief describing the landscape of federal citizen science, highlighting achieved and potential impacts, and demonstrating productive partnership models between agencies and sectors.</li>

          <li><em>Supporting coordination within and between agencies</em>
            . The Commons Lab Inventory will reduce search costs for agencies seeking collaborators, exemplar projects, research data and results, and other resources.</li>

          <li><em>Facilitating public analysis and engagement</em>
            . Through our
            interactive mapping tool, policymakers and the public may explore the
            range of citizen science and crowdsourcing projects. Individuals may
            also use this tool to find projects to contribute to.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Methodology</h3>
        <p>The information in the Commons Lab Inventory comes from a variety of
          sources.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>First, the Commons Lab compiles information from public sources
            including official websites and project blogs, and also from
            scientific literature, including journal articles and
            whitepapers. </li>
          <li>Second, projects are invited to <a href="about.html">submit their own information
            through an interactive web form</a>. This information is verified before
            it is published in the inventory. </li>
          <li>Third, the Commons Lab collaborates with employees at federal
            agencies to obtain information on citizen science and crowdsourcing
            activities. </li>
          <li>Fourth, the Commons Lab information data with existing
            inventories, such as USGS MyScience and Scistarter.com.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>What kinds of projects are included?</h3>
        <p>The Commons Lab Inventory includes
          <a href="http://www2.epa.gov/innovation/federal-community-practice-crowdsourcing-and-citizen-science">citizen science and crowdsourcing projects</a> that are funded or otherwise supported by federal agencies. For example, projects may be funded directly, or through grants from agencies such as EPA, NIH, and USGS. Some projects also receive in-kind support, such as equipment lending or support from agency personnel.</p>

        <p>Note that the Commons Lab Inventory does <strong>not</strong>
          include other forms of open innovation, such as prize competitions, or projects funded solely through the National Science Foundation (NSF).</p>

        <h3>Timeline</h3>
        <p>The majority of data collection will take place between April 1st, 2015 and July 1st, 2015. Following this period, the Commons Lab Inventory will be released to the general public. Information obtained during research will be published in a Wilson Center report describing the landscape of federal citizen science and crowdsourcing.</p>
