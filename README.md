# Crowdsourcing and citizen science inventory

This project is led by the [Commons Lab](http://wilsoncommonslab.org/ ) within the [Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars](https://wilsoncenter.org/). The Commons Labâ€™s mission is to mobilize public participation and innovation in science, technology, and policy through research and development.

Within this vision, the [Commons Lab Database](https://ccsinventory.wilsoncenter.org/) exists to characterize the value and diversity of federal crowdsourcing and citizen science to support coordination within and between agencies, and facilitate public analysis and engagement.

### The project

The website has been designed and developed by [iCarto](http://icarto.es).

It uses [CartoDB](http://cartodb.com/) as data and visualization backend. The frontend has been built with web technologies and libraries such as [backbone](http://backbonejs.org/), [leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/) and [bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/).
