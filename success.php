		<p>Our project submission process allows the Commons Lab to collect and maintain accurate and up-to-date information, while also respecting the potential sensitivity of the information shared. </p>
		<p>To support verification, a Commons Lab employee will contact a project coordinator within 3-5 days of receiving the form. The Commons Lab will collaborate with the project coordinator to finalize the database record, and discuss how potentially sensitive information will be presented. When verification is complete, the project will be published through the Commons Lab inventory and accessible through the mapped interface.</p>
